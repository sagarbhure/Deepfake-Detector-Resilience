# Deepfake Detector Resilience Tool 🕵️‍♂️🔍

The Deepfake Detector Resilience Tool is an open-source framework designed to assess the robustness of deepfake image detectors against adversarial attacks. It provides a platform to test and analyze the effectiveness of detection models in identifying synthetic media.

## Purpose ℹ️

With the rise of deepfake technology, the tool addresses the critical need for reliable detection methods. It helps researchers and developers:
- Evaluate deepfake detection models under various attack scenarios
- Enhance model resilience against adversarial examples
- Benchmark and compare detection performance on different datasets

## Demo Code Snippets 🖥️

### Loading and Evaluating a Deepfake Detector

```python
import torch
from deepfake_resilience_tool import load_detector, evaluate_detector

# Load a pre-trained deepfake detector
detector = load_detector('path/to/detector/model.pth')

# Evaluate the detector on a dataset
dataset = 'path/to/deepfake/dataset'
metrics = evaluate_detector(detector, dataset)

print("Evaluation Metrics:", metrics)
```

### Performing a White-Box Attack


```python
from deepfake_resilience_tool.attacks import WhiteBoxAttack

# Initialize the white-box attack
attack = WhiteBoxAttack(detector, epsilon=0.01)

# Generate adversarial examples
adversarial_images = attack.generate(dataset)

# Evaluate detector on adversarial examples
adversarial_metrics = evaluate_detector(detector, adversarial_images)

print("Adversarial Metrics:", adversarial_metrics)
```

### Performing a Black-Box Attack

```python
from deepfake_resilience_tool.attacks import BlackBoxAttack

# Initialize the black-box attack
attack = BlackBoxAttack(detector, num_iterations=100)

# Generate adversarial examples
adversarial_images = attack.generate(dataset)

# Evaluate detector on adversarial examples
adversarial_metrics = evaluate_detector(detector, adversarial_images)

print("Adversarial Metrics:", adversarial_metrics)
```
