The Deepfake Detector Resilience Tool is an open-source framework designed to assess the robustness of deepfake image detectors against adversarial attacks. It provides a platform to test and analyze the effectiveness of detection models in identifying synthetic media.

## Purpose ℹ️

With the rise of deepfake technology, the tool addresses the critical need for reliable detection methods. It helps researchers and developers:
- Evaluate deepfake detection models under various attack scenarios
- Enhance model resilience against adversarial examples
- Benchmark and compare detection performance on different datasets

## Demo Code Snippets 🖥️

### Loading and Evaluating a Deepfake Detector

```python
import torch
from deepfake_resilience_tool import load_detector, evaluate_detector

# Load a pre-trained deepfake detector
detector = load_detector('path/to/detector/model.pth')

# Evaluate the detector on a dataset
dataset = 'path/to/deepfake/dataset'
metrics = evaluate_detector(detector, dataset)

print("Evaluation Metrics:", metrics)
